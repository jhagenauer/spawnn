# SPAWNN 
### SPatial Analysis With self-organizing Neural Networks 

The SPAWNN toolkit is an innovative toolkit for spatial analysis with self-organizing neural networks which is particularily useful for spatial analysis, visualization and geographical data mining.

#### Features:
* Implements Self-Organizing Map and Neural Gas algorithms
* Supports different approaches for considering spatial dependence
* Provides linkage between networks and geographical data
* Implements powerful clustering algorithms for structuring the networks

#### Running
    
To run the toolkit, simply download the pre-build jar-file [here](https://github.com/jhagenauer/spawnn/releases/download/0.1.9/spawnn-0.1.9.jar) and execute it by double-clicking.
